                  <img src="dog.png" alt= "descibe image here for accessibility issues">
                  <p><b>Why:</b> Swimming is a great workout because you need to move your whole body against the resistance of the water.

                    Swimming is a good all-round activity because it:
                    
                    keeps your heart rate up but takes some of the impact stress off your body
                    builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness
                    helps you maintain a healthy weight, healthy heart and lungs
                    tones muscles and builds strength
                    provides an all-over body workout, as nearly all of your muscles are used during swimming. <br>
                     <b>How:</b> Float with your face in the water, your body straight and horizontal. Stack your hands and keep your arms and legs long.
                     Point your thumbs down.
                     Bring your hands together in front of your shoulders, thumbs pointing up.
                     Reach your arms forward.
                     Glide forward and repeat. <br>

                  <p><b>Why:</b> Cycling strengthens your heart muscles, lowers resting pulse and reduces blood fat levels. Research also shows that people who cycle to work have two to three times less exposure to pollution than car commuters, so their lung function is improved.<br>
                     <b>How:</b> Be sure to adjust the bike seat and handles to appropriate heights. Then, while holding good posture, start pedaling.  <br>

                  <img src="dog.png" alt= "descibe image here for accessibility issues">
                  <p><b>Why:</b> Rowing is a total-body workout, meaning it will strengthen major muscle groups in your arms, legs, and core and increase cardiovascular endurance. You may even notice some muscle gain. <br>
                     <b>How:</b> Sit all the way back in the rowing machine, and keep your back straight. First, push through the legs, and then pull through your arms. Once your legs are straightened and your arms are tucked into your chest, perform the opposite motion of the pulling portion. In other words, while staying controlled, allow your arms to extend, and then finally allow your legs to bend back into the starting position. Repeat this as many times as is necessary. <br>

                2. Higher impact exercises are okay. Since you have a relatively lower weight already, your joints are not stressed as severely by higher impact exercises, so if they burn more calories, go ahead and choose them.
                3. Pick something you enjoy. Since the key to keeping weight off is lifelong habits, make sure to pick exercises that you enjoy so that you are motivated to continue exercising throughout your life.</h1>

                    If you have never done any sports in the past, try a solo sport like disc golf, or an easier sport such as pickleball.
                    
                    Because sports are generally enjoyable, it is much easier to produce the motivation necessary to exercise each day.

                <h1>When trying to build muscle while having a high BMI, there are a few key principles to focus on when choosing exercises.
                1. Spend some time on calorie-burning exercises, and some time on muscle-building exercises. While there is overlap between these categories, it is important to lose weight while attempting to gain muscle. This is because weighlifting puts significant stress on the joints while losing weight helps take stress off the joints to stay healthy.
                2. Pick low impact calorie-burning exercises. Since weightlifting is already stressing the joints, try to pick lower impact calorie-burning exercises that do not stress the joints as severely.</h1>

                2. Bodyweight exercises are a good option. Especially if you do not have access to a gym, bodyweight exercises are a great option. Make sure that you pick several that work different parts of the body, however, to create a well-rounded and healthy physique. </h1>

                     Pushups can be performed on the floor with no equipment, so they are a great exercise for working out at home.

                  <p><b>Why:</b> Stand with feet just wider than hip-width apart, toes pointed slightly out, clasp hands at chest for balance. Send hips back and bend at knees to lower down as far as possible with chest lifted. You can swing your arms back for momentum. Press through heels back up to explode up, jumping vertically in the air. <br>
                     <b>How:</b> Squats help you to round out your muscle building program by working several leg muscles, including your quadriceps, gluteus maximus, and calves.

                     Similar to the pull up, the squat is a fantastic bodyweight exercise as it allows you to add weight simply by holding a household item of appropriate weight while performing the exercise.

                     <b>How:</b> Strength training is not just about bodybuilders lifting weights in a gym. Regular strength or resistance training is good for people of all ages and fitness levels to help prevent the natural loss of lean muscle mass that comes with aging (the medical term for this loss is sarcopenia). It can also benefit people with chronic health conditions, like obesity, arthritis, or a heart condition.<br>
